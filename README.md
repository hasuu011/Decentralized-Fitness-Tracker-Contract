# Decentralized-Fitness-Tracker-Contract# Decentralized Fitness Tracker

## Project Description

The Decentralized Fitness Tracker is a blockchain-based fitness monitoring system built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. This innovative platform allows users to securely record, track, and manage their fitness activities in a decentralized manner, ensuring complete ownership and privacy of their health data.

The system enables users to log daily activities including steps taken, calories burned, workout duration, and activity types, while maintaining comprehensive fitness summaries and historical records. All data is stored immutably on the blockchain, providing transparency, security, and user sovereignty over personal fitness information.
